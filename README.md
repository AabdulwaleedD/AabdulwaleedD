# 👋 Hi, I'm Abdulhamid Abdulwalid Danjuma

📊 **Data Analyst | Healthcare & Research Analytics | SQL • Python • Power BI**

I am a **Data Analyst with a strong biomedical background**, passionate about turning raw data into clear insights, reliable metrics, and decisions that matter — especially in **healthcare, life sciences, and research-driven domains**.

I hold a degree in **Human Anatomy** from **Sa’adu Zungur University, Bauchi**, where I focused on cancer biology, cell & molecular biology, and computational approaches to scientific research. Today, I apply that same analytical rigor to **data analysis, visualization, and insight generation**.

Former **President, Anatomical Students Society of Nigeria (ASSON) – SAZU Chapter**, where I led academic initiatives and promoted innovation and collaboration.
